    "As you will find out, the dataset is extensive, as it contains three decades worth of parliamentary proceedings. You can restrict yourself to a subset of the dataset, however that subset must not be trivial. Also keep in mind that a dataset that is too small may be fast to process, but may not be enough to produce good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to preprocess the data in any way that seems meaningful and that is likely to be conducive to good results. For instance, you may or may not remove punctuation, stopwords, very frequent or very rare words, etc. You can use any library for preprocessing, like [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) or [spaCy](https://spacy.io/); spaCy is more modern and faster. When developing the neural network solution you may do the preprocessing beforehand and / or using the TensorFlow facilities."

You may discuss with your fellow students in order to better understand the questions, if they are not clear enough, but you should not ask them to share their answers with you, or to help you by giving specific advice."
