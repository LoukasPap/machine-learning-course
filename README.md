# Assignments of the Machine Learning course
This repository, contains assignments that I handed over to my professor, for the purpose of the course.

## About üìù
* In the `Roseta Stone of Human Capital` assignment, I explored the relationship between many variables, which they were produced by combining various files. On the way through of our analysis, there are also diagrams accompanying the results.
* The assignment `Greek Parliament Proceedings`, is related with speeches pronounced by members of the Greek Parliament. The goal of the assignment, was to create models that classify in which political party the speaker belongs, by his speech. I carried out 3 classifications: 1 with **Neural Network** algorithm, and 2 with **non-Neural**.
* Both notebooks, provide detailed explanation of the procedure I followed, and their conclusions.

## Running ‚ö°Ô∏è
In case you want to run the notebooks by your own, you will need to download Jupyter Notebook from [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

## I thank üî•
